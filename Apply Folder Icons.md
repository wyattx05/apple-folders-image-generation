# How to apply generated Icons to a folder on Mac
Final step once you generate your icon is to apply it to the desired folder. I plan on making this process more automated in the future.

## Step 1
Save the image to your computer.

## Step 2
Right click on the image, go to quick actions, then select Remove Background.

## Step 3
Right click the folder you want to edit, select Get Info, then drag or copy and past the image into the top left hand corner icon.

Welcome to Folder Genie!
Using the Diffusion Bee app for Mac, I trained my own Image Generation model to generate custom color folders with icons on top to use for your Mac. I have gone through 6 different trainings of this model each time tweaking the dataset so the images generated are as good as can be. Right now I am on model 6 but I plan on now re-training that specific model instead of making a whole new one and plan to come out with a version 6.1 to see if it is any better. I also plan on trying other services that Diffusion Bee to train a model with my dataset to provide more options.

# Getting Started ü§ñ
1. Download Stable Diffusion Bee
       https://diffusionbee.com
2. Download my model on the Model 6 Download document
3. Look through the Prompts document and start generating your folders
4. Remove the background of the image and set the new image as your icon

#### For more instruction read through all the Model 6 Download & How to apply generated folder documents.

# Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è
- This model is not perfect and won't always give the result you want. Please follow the prompts suggested as that will work best.
- This page and project is still under construction so please keep that in mind.

# Other ‚ÑπÔ∏è
- Feel free to train the model with the dataset provided on any service of your choice.
- I plan on training a model and hosting it on hugging face in the future.

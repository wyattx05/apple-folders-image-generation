### Welcome to Folder Genie üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Using the Diffusion Bee app for Mac, I trained my own Image Generation model to generate custom color folders with icons on top to use for your Mac. I have gone through 6 different trainings of this model each time tweaking the dataset by adding images and ajusting the base prompts to get the best output. Read through Model Development to see each iteration. I trained this model on my Macbook Pro M3 Pro 18 GB of memory.

Model 6 was the first actual model released on Github as it gave the results I was looking for. Read through [Model Development](https://github.com/wyattx05/apple-folders-image-generation/blob/main/Model%20Development.md) to see each iteration and it's progression. Now I am on Model 6.1 which is a retrained version of model 6 with the same dataset and it has provided slightly better results but there wasn't that much improvment. I am figuring out the logistics of uploading that model right now.

# Getting Started ü§ñ
1. Download [Stable Diffusion Bee](https://diffusionbee.com)
2. Download my model: [Model 6](https://github.com/wyattx05/apple-folders-image-generation/blob/main/Model%206%20Download.md)
3. Look through the [Prompts document](https://github.com/wyattx05/apple-folders-image-generation/blob/main/Prompts.md)
4. Learn how to [set the new image as your icon](https://github.com/wyattx05/apple-folders-image-generation/blob/main/Apply%20Folder%20Icons.md)

# Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è
- This model is not perfect and won't always give the result you want. Please follow the prompts suggested as that will work best.
- This page and project is still under construction so please keep that in mind.

# Other ‚ÑπÔ∏è
- Feel free to train the model with the dataset provided on any service of your choice.
- I plan on training a model and hosting it on hugging face in the future.

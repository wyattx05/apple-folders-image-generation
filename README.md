Welcome to Folder Genie!
Using the Diffusion Bee app for Mac, I trained my own Image Generation model to generate custom color folders with icons on top to use for your Mac. I have gone through 6 different trainings of this model each time tweaking the dataset so the images generated are as good as can be. Right now I am on model 6 but I plan on now re-training that specific model instead of making a whole new one and plan to come out with a version 6.1 to see if it is any better. I also plan on trying other services that Diffusion Bee to train a model with my dataset to provide more options.

# How to use ü§ñ
1. Download Stable Diffusion Bee
       https://diffusionbee.com
2. Download my Folders Model then upload it to the application
3. Look through the prompts.txt file and start generating your folders
4. Remove the background of the image and set the new image as your icon

# Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è
- This model is not perfect and won't always give the result you want. Please follow the prompts suggested as that will work best!

# Other ‚ÑπÔ∏è
- Feel free to train the model with the dataset provided on any service of your choice.
- I plan on training a model and hosting it on hugging face in the future.
- People might think what is the point of this project if you created a bunch of folders for the dataset with pre existing tools, but I made this project becuase I just wanted to say what kind of folder I wanted and have it made instantly for me.

# Shout Outs üì£

Using the Diffusion Bee app for Mac, I trained my own Image Generation model to generate custom color folders with icons on top to use for your Mac.

How to use:
1. Download Stable Diffusion Bee
       https://diffusionbee.com
2. Download my Folders Model then upload it to the application
3. Look through the prompts.txt file and start generating your folders
4. Remove the background of the image and set the new image as your icon
